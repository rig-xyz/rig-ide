# Lifecycle Utilities

`Scope` and `ManagedSource` are dependency-light lifecycle utilities exported
from `@emdash/wire/util`.

- `Scope` owns cleanup for a tree of resources.
- `ManagedSource` turns demand into a retained resource with ref-counted leases.

They do not define wire messages and can run in browser, renderer, main process,
or tests.

## Scope

Use a scope when a feature creates more than one disposable resource and those
resources should die together:

```ts
import { createScope } from '@emdash/wire/util';

const scope = createScope({ label: 'conversation:abc', logger });

scope.add(() => detachLiveState());
scope.add(() => removeWindowListener());
scope.use({ dispose: () => runtime.dispose() });

await scope.dispose();
```

Semantics:

- Cleanups run in reverse registration order.
- Child scopes dispose before the parent's own cleanups.
- Cleanup errors are reported through `onCleanupError` and do not stop later
  cleanups.
- `dispose()` is idempotent.
- `add()` on an already disposed scope runs the cleanup immediately.

That last rule makes async attach/dispose races easier to handle:

```ts
const scope = createScope();
await scope.dispose();

scope.add(() => detachTopic()); // runs immediately
```

## Scope Logging

Every scope has `scope.log`. If a logger is supplied at the root, children
inherit it with a `scope` binding for the accumulated label path:

```ts
const runtimeScope = createScope({ label: 'runtime', logger });
const sessionScope = runtimeScope.child('session:one');

sessionScope.log.info('session attached');
```

Default cleanup error handling logs through the scope logger:

```ts
const scope = createScope({ label: 'view', logger });
scope.add(() => {
  throw new Error('cleanup failed');
});

await scope.dispose(); // logger.warn('wire scope cleanup failed', ...)
```

Custom cleanup handlers receive `{ label, labelPath, logger }`:

```ts
const scope = createScope({
  label: 'root',
  onCleanupError: (error, context) => {
    context.logger.warn('custom cleanup failure', {
      labelPath: context.labelPath,
      error,
    });
  },
});
```

Use `describeScope(scope)` to inspect the live label tree:

```ts
console.log(describeScope(runtimeScope));
```

The description contains labels, label paths, disposed state, and child
descriptions. It does not expose cleanup callbacks.

## Child Scopes

Use child scopes to model ownership:

```ts
const runtimeScope = createScope({ label: 'runtime' });
const sessionScope = runtimeScope.child('session:one');

sessionScope.add(() => stopSession());
runtimeScope.add(() => stopRuntime());

await runtimeScope.dispose();
```

Disposing `runtimeScope` disposes `sessionScope` first, then `stopRuntime()`.
Disposing `sessionScope` directly deregisters it from the parent so it does not
dispose twice later.

## ManagedSource

`ManagedSource` is useful when a resource should exist only while somebody is
using it: a live topic binding, a renderer view model, a preview server, or a
process-backed session.

```ts
import { createManagedSource } from '@emdash/wire/util';

const sessions = createManagedSource({
  scope: runtimeScope,
  label: 'sessions',
  key: (input: { conversationId: string }) => input.conversationId,
  graceMs: 30_000,
  create: async ({ conversationId }, scope) => {
    const session = await startSession(conversationId);
    scope.add(() => session.stop());
    return session;
  },
  onError: (error, key) => logger.warn('session creation failed', { key, error }),
});
```

`create(key, scope)` is also the disposal hook. Register teardown on the supplied
scope as soon as resources are acquired. If creation later fails, the scope is
disposed and partial resources are cleaned up.

Behavior:

- The first `acquire()` for a key calls `create()`.
- Concurrent acquires for the same key share the in-flight creation.
- Each lease increments the refcount.
- `release()` is idempotent.
- The last release starts the grace timer.
- Acquire during the grace timer cancels teardown and reuses the active value.
- Failed creation is not cached; the next acquire retries.
- `peek(key)` returns the active value if creation has completed.
- `dispose()` force-disposes every active or retained entry.
- Passing `scope` attaches the source and all keyed entries to a parent scope.
  Disposing that parent scope force-disposes the source and rejects later
  acquisitions. `label` names the source node in `describeScope()` output.

Usage:

```ts
const lease = sessions.acquire({ conversationId: 'abc' });
const session = await lease.ready();

await lease.release();
await sessions.dispose();
```

Parent scopes are useful for runtimes with several keyed resources:

```ts
const authScope = runtimeScope.child('auth');
const logins = createManagedSource({
  scope: authScope,
  label: 'login-source',
  key: (providerId: string) => providerId,
  create: async (providerId, scope) => {
    const login = await startLoginPty(providerId);
    scope.add(() => login.dispose());
    return login;
  },
});

await authScope.dispose(); // also disposes every active login entry
```

## Grace Windows

Use `graceMs` for resources whose demand can flap briefly. For example, a window
reload may detach and reattach live model bindings within a few hundred
milliseconds. A short grace window avoids tearing down the underlying resource
only to recreate it immediately.

```ts
const bindings = createManagedSource({
  key: (key: { taskId: string }) => key.taskId,
  graceMs: 5_000,
  create: async (key, scope) => {
    const binding = client.task.transcript(key, (state) => render(state));
    scope.add(() => binding.dispose());
    await binding.ready;
    return binding;
  },
});
```
