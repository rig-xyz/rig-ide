# Optimistic Live Model Groups

`OptimisticLiveModel` is a MobX-backed client utility for
`liveModel` endpoints. It derives local previews from inline group
mutation handlers when they exist, then rolls those previews forward or back as
authoritative live updates arrive.

Import it from the MobX subpath:

```ts
import { OptimisticLiveModel } from '@emdash/wire/util/mobx';
```

## Contract Requirements

`OptimisticLiveModel` works with `liveModel` definitions.
Previews require inline mutation handlers; schema-only mutations skip the local
preview and settle normally after the server response.

```ts
const api = defineContract({
  conversation: liveModel({
    key: conversationKeySchema,
    states: {
      state: liveState({ data: stateSchema }),
      usage: liveState({ data: usageSchema }),
    },
    mutations: {
      setTitle: mutation(
        { input: z.object({ title: z.string() }), data: stateSchema, error: z.string() },
        (ctx, input) => {
          ctx.produce('state', (draft) => {
            (draft as { title: string }).title = input.title;
          });
          ctx.produce('usage', (draft) => {
            (draft as { tokens: number }).tokens += input.title.length;
          });
          return ok({ title: input.title });
        }
      ),
    },
  }),
});
```

## Client Usage

Create the normal live model host and typed client, then create a replica and
wrap it with `OptimisticLiveModel`:

```ts
const conversations = createLiveModelHost(api.conversation);
conversations.create(key, {
  state: { title: 'Initial' },
  usage: { tokens: 0 },
});

const controller = createController(api, { conversation: conversations });

const contractClient = client(api, connect(pair.left));
const replica = createLiveModelReplica(api.conversation, contractClient.conversation);
const conversation = new OptimisticLiveModel(api.conversation, key, replica);
await conversation.ready;
```

The public surface separates observable values from mutation methods:

```ts
console.log(conversation.values.state); // { title: 'Initial' }

const setTitle = conversation.mutations.setTitle({ title: 'Optimistic wire' });
console.log(conversation.values.state); // optimistic value immediately
console.log(conversation.isPending); // true

const result = await setTitle;
await result.settled;
console.log(conversation.isPending); // false

await conversation.dispose();
await replica.dispose();
```

## Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  call[Call group mutation] --> local[Run inline handler on overlay context]
  local --> preview[Commit overlay recipes to member cells]
  preview --> wire[Send real mutation with same mutationId]
  wire --> confirm[Tagged live updates drop overlays atomically]
  wire --> rollback[Error Result or throw rolls back overlays]
  confirm --> settled[settled resolves after cursors are observed]
```

Details:

- The local handler run is used only for its `ctx.produce()` side effects. The
  server result is authoritative.
- The wire call uses the same generated mutation id as the overlay. When a live
  model update arrives with that id, the relevant member overlay is removed in
  the same MobX action as the authoritative base update.
- If the server returns an error result or throws, all overlays for that mutation
  id are removed.
- If a seed/resync lands, all pending overlays for that member are cleared
  because the snapshot is authoritative.
- `settled.finally` also clears overlays as a safety net after cursor settling.

## Handler Purity

Group mutation handlers may run on both server and client. Keep them pure:

- OK: derive values from input and current member drafts.
- OK: call `ctx.produce()` on one or more group members.
- Avoid: network calls, filesystem access, time, randomness, and server-only
  stores in the inline handler.

If a workflow needs server-only work, keep that work outside the inline group
handler and model it as a `procedure()` or `liveJob()` that updates domain state.

`@emdash/wire/util/mobx` intentionally has a separate subpath export because it
depends on MobX. Server-only code should import lifecycle utilities from
`@emdash/wire/util`.
