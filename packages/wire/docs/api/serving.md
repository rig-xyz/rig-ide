# Serving and Clients

The API layer turns a contract into a server-side `Controller`, serves it over a
`WireTransport`, and creates a typed client over the matching transport.

## Creating a Controller

`createController(contract, impl)` maps each endpoint to server behavior:

```ts
const controller = createController(
  notesApi,
  {
    session: sessionsHost,
    activity: () => activityLogServer,
    clearNotes: (input) => {
      instance.states.notes.produce((draft) => {
        draft.notes = [];
      });
      return instance.states.notes.snapshot().data;
    },
  }
);
```

The `impl` object is keyed by the contract shape. Procedures receive
`(input, meta)`. Jobs use `{ run, toError? }`, a `LiveJobClientHandle`, or a
`LiveJobReplica`. Live logs use resolver functions, `LiveLogClientHandle`s, or
`LiveLogReplica`. Event streams use `createEventStreamHost()`, resolver functions,
or `EventStreamClientHandle`s. Live model contracts use a `createLiveModelHost()`,
`LiveModelClientHandle`, or `LiveModelReplica`.

Mutation idempotency is configured on `createLiveModelHost()`, not on the
controller. The controller only routes calls, snapshots, attachments, and live
mutation procedure envelopes.

Live model hosts are separate from the contract because live model instances are
runtime resources. A controller can be created once, while conversations,
sessions, or windows create and dispose keyed host instances over time.

See [../../examples/controller/controller.ts](../../examples/controller/controller.ts).

## Serving

`serve(transport, controller, options?)` listens for protocol messages:

- `call` invokes `controller.call(path, input, meta)`.
- `snapshot` calls `LiveSource.snapshot()`.
- `attach` subscribes to a live source and forwards `update` messages.
- `detach` unsubscribes.
- `cancel` aborts an in-flight call by id.

```ts
const pair = memoryTransportPair();
const stop = serve(pair.right, controller, {
  logger,
  instrumentation: loggerInstrumentation(logger),
});
```

`serve()` returns an unsubscribe. Call it when the transport or server session
goes away. It also aborts in-flight calls and detaches live subscriptions when
the transport disconnects or when the serve loop is disposed.

## Validation

Controller validation is applied explicitly at the serving boundary with
`withValidation(contract, controller, policy)`:

```ts
const controller = createController(notesApi, impl);
const servedController = withValidation(
  notesApi,
  controller,
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'inputs' : 'full'
);
const stop = serve(pair.right, servedController);
```

Policies:

- `none`: no schema parsing.
- `inputs`: parse procedure inputs, upload/download inputs, live model mutation
  envelopes, job start/cancel inputs, and live topic keys before delegating.
- `full`: includes `inputs`, then also parses procedure outputs, upload/download
  results, mutation results, and live job start results.

Use `inputs` for production boundaries that receive values from another process
or client. Inputs cross a trust boundary and should stay parsed even when output
validation is too expensive. Use `full` in development and tests to catch handler
contract drift quickly.

`withValidation()` validates request/response values that pass through
`Controller.call()` and live topic keys passed to `Controller.resolveLive()`.
Live job progress, result, error values, and event stream payloads are emitted
later as live updates and are not intercepted by the middleware.

## Connecting

`connect(transport, options?)` creates a low-level `Connection`:

```ts
const connection = connect(pair.left, { instrumentation });
```

`Connection` supports:

- `call(path, input, { signal? })`.
- `snapshot(topic)`.
- `attach(topic, push, { onReattach? })`.
- `onDisconnect(cb)`.

On disconnect, pending calls reject with `WireError` code `DISCONNECTED`.
Existing attachments are retained locally. If the transport exposes
`onReconnect`, `connect()` re-issues active `attach` requests after the replacement
link is live and then calls each attachment's `onReattach` callback.

Replicas use `onReattach` for live models, logs, and jobs to force a fresh
snapshot after reattach. Direct client-handle consumers can use the same callback when
they need to reseed UI state after reconnect.

The protocol layer intentionally has no version handshake. Receivers validate the
message `kind` and required fields in `isWireMessage()`; unknown message kinds are
ignored by transport adapters that parse untrusted frames.

## Typed Clients

`client(contract, connection)` returns a `ContractClient` with the same nested
shape as the contract:

```ts
const contractClient = client(notesApi, connection);

const sessions = createLiveModelReplica(notesApi.session, contractClient.session, {
  onChange: {
    notes: (state, meta) => {
      console.log('notes model:', state, meta.kind);
    },
  },
});
const lease = sessions.acquire({ sessionId: 'demo' });
const session = await lease.ready();

const added = await session.mutations.addNote({ text: 'Typed client mutation' });
await added.settled;
await lease.release();
await sessions.dispose();
```

Live model and live log accessors are client handles. Use `state(key, name)` or
`handle(key)` to snapshot/attach without local state, or pass the client handle
to a replica wrapper.

Mutations return `ContractMutationInvocation`:

```ts
type ContractMutationInvocation<D, E> = {
  result: LiveMutationResult<D, E>;
  settled: Promise<void>;
};
```

`MutationCallOptions` lets callers provide a `mutationId` and retry policy:

```ts
await session.mutations.addNote({ text: 'Optimistic title' }, {
  mutationId: 'custom-mutation',
  retry: { maxRetries: 1 },
});
```

See [../../examples/api-client/client.ts](../../examples/api-client/client.ts).

## Cancellation

Wire supports cooperative cancellation for request messages. The client sends a
protocol message for the request id:

```ts
{ kind: 'cancel', id: callId }
```

Typed procedure clients accept an optional `{ signal }` argument:

```ts
const abort = new AbortController();
const result = client.slowOperation({ id: 'task' }, { signal: abort.signal });

abort.abort();
await result; // rejects with WireError code CANCELLED
```

If the signal is already aborted, the call rejects locally without posting.
Server procedure handlers receive the same signal through `CallMeta`:

```ts
const controller = createController(api, {
  slowOperation: async (input, meta) => {
    await abortableWork(input, meta.signal);
    return { ok: true };
  },
});
```

Cancellation is cooperative. Long-running handlers should pass the signal into
their own async work, listen for `abort`, or periodically check
`meta.signal?.aborted`. `snapshot` and `attach` requests also share the same
server-side cancellation registry, though most live sources complete those
requests synchronously.

Mutations are intentionally not cancellable through this API; they use
`mutationId` for idempotency and retry. See [mutations](../live/mutations.md).
Cancelling a `liveJob().start` wire call does not cancel the spawned job; job
cancellation is domain-level through the generated `<path>.cancel` procedure.

## Composing Controllers

Middle tiers compose by creating a typed client for the upstream contract and
passing client handles, local handlers, or replicas into a new controller. This
keeps forwarding typed and makes the chosen interception points explicit:

If the middle tier should only relay the entire upstream contract, use
`forwardController(contract, client)` instead of spelling out every endpoint:

```ts
const upstream = client(workspaceApi, connect(upstreamTransport));
const controller = forwardController(workspaceApi, upstream);
```

Use explicit `createController()` composition when the hop needs local behavior:

```ts
const upstreamConnection = connect(upstreamTransport);
const upstream = client(workspaceApi, upstreamConnection);

const conversations = createLiveModelReplica(workspaceApi.conversation, upstream.conversation, {
  retentionMs: 10 * 60_000,
});

const controller = createController(workspaceApi, {
  // Local override.
  ping: async () => 'desktop-main',

  // Stateless forwarding.
  git: upstream.git,

  // Stateful interception/cache before serving downstream clients.
  conversation: conversations,
});
```

For nested contracts, object destructuring is enough to assemble the
implementation shape:

```ts
const controller = createController(appApi, {
  ...upstream,
  settings: {
    ...upstream.settings,
    save: async (input, meta) => {
      await auditSettingsChange(input, meta.signal);
      return upstream.settings.save(input, meta);
    },
  },
});
```

Use replicas when the middle tier needs to inspect, cache, or transform live
state before exposing it downstream. Use client handles directly when the middle
tier is only forwarding calls and live sources.

## Multi-Window Sessions

`createWireSessionHub(controller)` serves the same controller to multiple
transport sessions:

```ts
const hub = createWireSessionHub(controller);
const pair = memoryTransportPair();

hub.open('window-1', pair.right);
const contractClient = client(api, connect(pair.left));
```

Opening the same session id closes the previous transport. `close(id)` closes
one session and calls `transport.close?.()` after disposing the serve loop.
`dispose()` closes all sessions and calls `controller.dispose?.()`.

See [../../examples/multi-window/client.ts](../../examples/multi-window/client.ts).

## Server-Side Call Helpers

`deduplicateRequests(fn, options?)` wraps procedure implementations to share one
in-flight promise for identical inputs:

```ts
const controller = createController(api, {
  expensiveStats: deduplicateRequests(async (input) => {
    return await loadStats(input.repo, input.branch);
  }),
});
```

Behavior:

- Default key is `stableStringify(input)`, so object property order does not
  matter.
- Only in-flight calls are deduplicated. Settled calls are not cached.
- Rejections are not cached.
- `meta.signal` is not part of the key and shared execution is not aborted by
  one caller.
- Do not wrap mutations; mutation idempotency is handled by `mutationId`.
